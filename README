Test-A8N version 0.02
=====================

Test::A8N was created as a mechanism for writing and running automated
storytests in a human-readable and reusable fashion.  Its storytest files
are easily readable, are natural to write, and are easy for non-technical
users to read, while still being easy for developers to automate.

The tests themselves are written in YAML, and while they have a specific
structure, it doesn't limit test author's flexibility.  And many of the
features of YAML, most notably its concept of creating pointers between
different parts of a document, means reusing parts of your tests for use
elsewhere is trivial.
